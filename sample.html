    <p>All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: !DOCTYPE html tag.
        The HTML document itself begins with html and ends with /html tag.
        The visible part of the HTML document is between body and /body tag.</p>
    <p>A HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.</p>
    <p>HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.</p>
    <p>HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.</p>
    <p>A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.</p>
